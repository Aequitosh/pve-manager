# Fixes two issues for Proxmox VE systems:
# 1. inheriting MAC from the first slave, instead of using a random one, avoids
#    that locked down network environments (e.g., at most hosting providers)
#    will block traffic due to a unexpected MAC in the outgoing network packets
# 2. Avoids that systemd keeps bridge offline if there are no slaves connected,
#    failing, e.g., setting up s-NAT if no guest is (yet) started.
